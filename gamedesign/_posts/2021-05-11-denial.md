Denial is about ignoring reality. Not refusing it but completely ignoring it.
We want to orient the gameplay around environmental physical puzzles here. Because discovering things, seems like a good answer for fighting inside the Denial world.
For the default environment we chose a garden of babylon like environment. An old but calm and charming civilization, completely empty and covered by a mist.
If the environment represent the Denial, then the ability of the players here need to fight it in some way.
We chose the Alter World Sphere, a sphere that will switch the Denial world to the Reality one.
And to make it more usefull, while allowing complexe puzzle mechanisms, we chose the Magnet Grab as the second ability. Which allow the player to grab specific objects like in Zelda : BOTW.

## Abilities
### Alter World Sphere

Technicaly complexe to do correctly, but the concept is straightforward : there is 2 world, the denial one and the reality one. The area inside the sphere switch from the Denial world to the Reality world.
Some objects will only be in the denial world, and some only in the reality world. The simplest example would be a wall who isn't in the reality world, so using the sphere would open a path for the player.
But to make things more interesting, some objects will be allowed to cross the worlds. Which means, for example, that we could hide a key of a denial world mechanism inside the reality world. So the player will have to find it and bring it into the Denial world.

### Magnet Grab

If you know the magnet power of Zelda : BOTW, you simply add an automatic focus and you have the current version of our Magnet Grab.
Which means that if a grabbable object is inside your range and you trigger the ability, the object will come toward you and stay on your back, levitating.
Trigger it again, and it will be nicely put in front of your feet.
As said before, grabbed objects can swap the world they belong too, by been put inside our outside the Alter World Sphere.
From a basic game design point of view, we wanted to allow moving parts of the environment without having to push/pull which is slow and not needed here.

## Puzzles
Denial puzzles are physical based environmental puzzles, which make it similar to Zelda : BOTW but deeper and more plateforming oriented.

To achieve this, the puzzle generation will use the following tools (simple version for the prototype):
* Moving plateforms (Classic elements)
* Crumbling plateforms (Plateforms which deasappear temporarly after the player touch them)
* Spirit Stones (First version will only use them as key for the mechanisms)
* Spirit Circuits (Using a socle, they connect Spirit Stones and mechanisms)
* Mechanisms (An element which has several state of activation, need one or several Spirit Stones energy. ie: doors, brigdes, plateforms...)
* Element exclusive to one world (Mainly used to have walls only in the Denial world, and to hide Spirit Stones in the reality world. But can be used for anything.)
* Blocking path elements (Elements or disposition which require to use the air jump)
* Crumbling walls (Walls which can fell on the player)
* Portals (Classic elements)
* Clues (Small elements which the shape depend of the environment, they can indicate hidden places)

Anger is about losing control. It often result as wanting to break things, but the main aspect is that you're no longer able to control yourself.
We want to orient the gameplay around speed and control loss. Like a Sonic game on ice.
For the default environment we chose a volcano to climb. With floating rocks and scrapps of metal from destroyed structures.
The environment and the base physic represent the Anger, so the ability need to help the player to keep control of the character movements.
We chose the dash as the first ability, which isn't affected by the "ice effect". And we added a precise mode, where you can see where you will land after the dash.
We are still unsure of if the dash or at least the precise mode, should consume the "ice effect" accumulated or not.
The second ability we chose is Gravity Rush, which snap the player to the closest surface, including walls and ceillings.

## Abilities
### Dash

This ability has 2 parts.
The classic dash, which is a full lenght instant dash that you can trigger by quickly pressing the ability button.
And the controlled dash, which start if you kept the button pressed and will show you a preview of where you will get releasing the button.
The high speed the dash gives you, can break elements if you accumulated enough "ice effect".

### Gravity Rush

The prototype version is an ability, which once activated, will automatically snap on the closest surface you're trying to walk on.
We would like the ice effect to be kept, and too amplify the gravity which could result in some downward dash if there is nothing around you.
But for now it is be a snapping tool.

## Puzzles
Anger puzzles are speed oriented areas that are crumbling and can be destroyed when your speed is high enough.

To achieve this, the puzzle generation will use the following tools (simple version for the prototype):
* Moving plateforms (But it can never stop the player to run, if the timing is good)
* Crumbling environments (Visual effect generated by the high speed on the environments, they can broke at high speed)
* Hidden elements (Elements you need to be "close" to see. The goal is to train the player reflexes)
* Slow down areas (Classic elements)
* Wind blasts (Will push anything going inside)
* Lava blasts (Will push and hurt anything going inside)
* Lava projectile (Elements or disposition which require to use the air jump)
* Bloking elements (Elements or diposition which require to use jump + dash)
* Hurting surfaces (Surfaces you can't walk on, mainly there to prevent gravity rush usage)
